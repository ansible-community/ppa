# ppa

## Repo Overview

This repo uses GitHub Actions & Workflows to generate / upload Debian & Ubuntu builds to the https://launchpad.net/~ansible PPAs. See https://github.com/ansible-community/ppa/issues/1 for the latest PPA / Ansible / Ubuntu version matrix.

## Repo Structure

### Branches

Along with the `main` branch, there is currently a branch for each major Ansible release. This is due to the build differences between versions of Ansible.

```
% git branch
  ansible-2.8
  ansible-2.9
  ansible-2.10
  ansible-3
  ansible-4
  ansible-5
* main
```

## GitHub Actions / Workflows

Currently, GitHub will only run `cron` scheduled workflows on the `main` branch (also note: `cron` scheduled workflows are disabled after 60 days of "inactivity"). So instead of running each of the individual branches as their own scheduled workflow, we use the `latest_builds.yml` workflow on the `main` branch to kick off builds on the other branches (via the repo `secret` `PAT` (GitHub Personal Access Token)) as necessary.

The `latest_builds.yml` workflow uses the `latest_builds/requirements.txt` file to install the required packages and then runs the `latest_builds/latest_builds.py` script. The `latest_builds/latest_builds.py` script uses the `latest_builds/matrix.yml` to compare PyPI and against the various https://launchpad.net/~ansible PPAs to see if a new build is necessary. If a new build is necessary it triggers the appropriate workflow on the appropriate branch.

### `.github/actions/{action.yml,setup.sh}`

These files take care of the common `.dput.cf` generation and gpg key setup.

### `.github/workflows/{ansible-core,ansible,resolvelib}.yml`

These files handle the respective builds.

### Triggering Jobs Manually

Manual runs of the `latest_builds.yml` workflow can be triggered via the GitHub Actions UI and manual runs of the specific branch / workflows can be triggered via the GitHub API. For more information about triggering jobs manually via the GitHub API; see the following example:

```
# First GET the workflows:

# Then (for example) to generate new 5.3.0-2ppa~focal & 5.3.0-2ppa~impish builds for the ansible-5 PPA, you could make the following POST request. Note the 7276925 workflow ID used from the previous request to denote the ansible (.github/workflows/ansible.yml) workflow.

% curl --location --request POST 'https://api.github.com/repos/ansible-community/ppa/actions/workflows/7276925/dispatches' \
--header 'Authorization: token ghp_ACTUAL_GITHUB_PAT_TOKEN_GOES_HERE' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '    {
        "ref": "ansible-5",
        "inputs": {
            "DEB_DIST": "focal impish",
            "DEB_VERSION": "5.3.0",
            "DEB_RELEASE": "2ppa",
            "LAUNCHPAD_PROJECT": "~ansible",
            "LAUNCHPAD_PPA": "ansible-5"
        }
    }'
```

## Lifecycle

### Test Environment

High level general steps

1. Setup launchpad project with GPG keys
    1. Create a PPA for each of the versions you intend to test via the `latest_builds/matrix.yml`
1. Fork this repo
    1. Create / Update repo secrets appropriately
    1. Verify the workflows are available under the repo actions (there should be one for each package you intend to build). **Note:** At the time of this writing, there seems to be an issue with workflows needing an event other than `workflow_dispatch` to register. Here is a brief example of a workaround:
        1. Check out the `ansible-5` branch
        1. Modify each of the `.github/workflows/{ansible-core,ansible,resolvlib}.yml` files so that the `on` value also includes `push`
            ```
            on:
              push:
                branches:
                  - 'ansible-5'
              workflow_dispatch:
            ```
        1. Commit and push that to your fork (at this point you should now see the workflows registered under your repo actions)
        1. Reset to the previous commit and force push (you only needed that commit to get the workflows to register, after they are registerd, you no longer need that commit)
1. Wait for scheduled jobs / Trigger Jobs Manually

### New versions

Example of adding a new build: Ansible 6

1. Create a new `ansible-6` branch in the repo
1. Create a new `testing-ansible-6` PPA
1. Based on the `ansible-core` / `ansible` requirements determine which versions of Ubuntu make sense and what other requirements you might need to provide
    1. Check the release cycle for currently supported Ubuntu releases https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle
    1. Check the provided `python3` versions https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=python3&searchon=names&exact=1&suite=all&section=all
    1. Check the provided `resolvelib` versions https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=python3-resolvelib&searchon=names&exact=1&suite=all&section=all
1. Use the version information to create an entry in the `latest_builds/matrix.yml`
    ```
    testing-ansible-6:  # name used for PPA unless launchpad_ppa is specified
      github_branch: ansible-6
      packages:
        - name: resolvelib
          version_specifier: "==0.5.4"
          dists:
            - focal
        - name: ansible-core
          version_specifier: "~=2.13.0a"  # includes alpha releases
          dists:
            - focal
            - impish
            - jammy
        - name: ansible
          version_specifier: "~=6.0a"  # includes alpha releases
          dists:
            - focal
            - impish
            - jammy
    ```
    For more information on the `version_specifier` see https://packaging.pypa.io/en/latest/specifiers.html
1. Update the build matrix in https://github.com/ansible-community/ppa/issues/1
1. Wait for the next scheduled run or manually kick off another build.
1. Once the builds are completed successfully, add (or bump the version of an existing entry) for the `testing-ansible` PPA
    ```
    testing-ansible-ansible-6:
      github_branch: ansible-6
      launchpad_ppa: testing-ansible  # name used for the PPA
      packages:
        - name: resolvelib
          version_specifier: "==0.5.4"
          dists:
            - focal
        - name: ansible-core
          version_specifier: "~=2.13.0a"
          dists:
            - focal
            - impish
            - jammy
        - name: ansible
          version_specifier: "~=6.0a"
          dists:
            - focal
            - impish
            - jammy
    ```
1. Once the testing is completed, repeat the process for the non-testing PPAs
    1. Create a new `ansible-6` PPA
    1. Add / modify the appropriate entries to the `latest_builds/matrix.yml`
        ```
        ansible-6:
          github_branch: ansible-6
          packages:
            - name: resolvelib
              version_specifier: "==0.5.4"
              dists:
                - focal
            - name: ansible-core
              version_specifier: "~=2.13.0"
              dists:
                - focal
                - impish

              version_specifier: "~=6.0"
              dists:
                - focal
                - impish
                - jammy
        ```

        ```
        ansible-ansible-6:
          github_branch: ansible-6
          launchpad_ppa: ansible
          packages:
            - name: resolvelib
              version_specifier: "==0.5.4"
              dists:
                - focal
            - name: ansible-core
              version_specifier: "~=2.13.0"
              dists:
                - focal
                - impish
                - jammy
            - name: ansible
              version_specifier: "~=6.0"
              dists:
                - focal
                - impish
                - jammy
        ```

### Old versions

Old versions will begin to age out automatically in 1 of 2 ways:

1. Once the Ubuntu version hits the end of its lifecycle, launchpad will start rejecting new builds for that version. At the point, it's a good idea to remove that dist from the matrix to save on unnecessary builds.
1. Shortly after a new major release of Ansible, the previous major release will stop updating, therefore it will not trigger any new builds for older versions.

Previously, old PPAs / releases were left alone for archival purposes.
